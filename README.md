# Rocket_Elevators_Information_System

This repository contains the work of Shaphan Charles team from week 4 of CodeBoxx's Odyssey program. The code contained is an adaptation of Shaphan's Genesis project to work within a Ruby on Rails framework.

Devise was used to create the login sections of the page, and Rails Admin was used to construct the admin portion.

All quotes entered in the form are saved into the quotes table of the database. They are accessible through the admin section of the website and can be modified from there.

Users are able to be added/modified through the admin page as well as the regular sign up, and can be given admin privelages there as well.

A new employee can be added to the table after they have a user created for them, and their specific user can be selected from the menu avaliable.

The admin section is only accessible to an admin user once they are logged in.

All members of CodeBoxx from the employees list provided are able to log in as an admin user using the email provided and the password 123456.

One aditional user was created, admin@admin.ca, with a password of 123456 as well.

The fully deployed version of this website can be found at recharles.com.
